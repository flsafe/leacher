* DONE clear completed downloads
* TODO priority of downloads, move up and down in ui
  - probably need to use a loop and alt!! thing that tries to push from state onto chan rather than just blocking on adding all then enable ui to re-order and send messa
* TODO more than one file download concurrent
  - currently more than one segment, but limited to single file
* TODO add nzb via web interface
  - drag and drop, or just file open dialogue? seems weird to upload file to local server though...
* TODO cancel download via ui
* TODO pause download via ui
* TODO automatically run par2 on downloads to verify
* TODO automatically extract rar archives?
* TODO cleanup should delete rar files and par files when completed successfully?
* TODO visualize traffic speed over time with rolling timeseries?
* TODO separate tab in ui for completed downloads perhaps (indicate number in tab)
  - tabs for All | Active | Paused | Completed ?
* TODO fix issue with speed timing where decoding time is used as part of calculation
  - need some more timing information
  - waiting -> downloading    -> decoding     -> cleaning     -> completed
               downloading-at    decoding-at     cleaning-at     completed-at
               |-- download ----|-- decoding --|-- cleaning ----|
               |----------------- total time -------------------|
